# Discord office hour instructions

> All this information should also be in the <tt>#instructions</tt> channel on Discord.

*  During office hours, add yourself to the open queue at [{{site.ohq_site}}]({{site.ohq_site}}).
   Your position in the queue may be reset between office hours. A short description of the problem or question is highly recommended to make the queue more efficient.
   You should be able to update your description without taking yourself off the queue.

*  Next, connect to the üîäwaiting-room voice channel, or to one of the "Public" voice channels.

*  When it is your chance to get help, a TA will move you from the üîäwaiting-room to one of the TA channels.

## Screensharing

*  If asked, you can share your screen to this voice channel, by clicking the screenwith arrow pointing out of it button in the bottom-left <img src="files/continuity-images/screenshare-icon.png">. A TA might alternately give you instructions join a Zoom call for better quality.

## No voice?

*  If you cannot use voice for some reason, we will do our best provide help via text. Please let us know in your problem description in the queue if this will be the case.
