# Your task

Go to <a href="{{site.submit_site}}cachelab/cachelab.php" target="_top">the lab interface</a> and follow the instructions. Each student will be required to:

*   complete 3 questions which gives you a set of cache parameters (tag bits, number of sets, etc.) and ask you to fill in the remaining one
*   complete 1 question which gives you a set of cache parameters and a list of memory accesses, and asks you to fill in the tag, index, and offsets of each access, and the results of the accesses (hit, miss, etc.)

If you get a question wrong, you can request a new questions of that type until you get the required number correct. If you don't manage to get enough questions completely correct by the time of the lab is due, we grade you based on your best results.
